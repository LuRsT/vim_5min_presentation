# Why should you use vim?

This was a lightning talk given @codebits ( http://codebits.eu ) and @oxfordgeeks (http://oxford.geeknights.net/)i #32, I will be updating it with notes to give a little more insight into the vim features I described in the talk.

## Quick Notes

Vim is very friendly, if you need some help with any feature that want to explore, just type in NORMAL mode :help <name of feature>.

If you're a total noob with vim, I'd recommend something like this: http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/text_editing/vim.html.en#TUTORME-VIM
